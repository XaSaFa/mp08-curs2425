# Activitat Classroom

Take [this free courses of the Udemy platform](https://www.udemy.com/es/courses/free/?lang=en&sort=recommended) as an example and create your own course in Classroom.

You have to use a free gmail account because the iaballester one doesn't allow you to create courses.

- Choose one of the Udemy courses and make your own course on the subject.
- The course will have two separate themes on the selected subject. 
  - Each theme will have:
    - A material in pdf format.
    - A material that is a link to a Youtube video.
    - One question.
    - One task.
    - One task with a form attached.
   
- You have to look for two students (classmates) to do the activities and enroll them to the course.
- You have to rate the activities of your students.

Create a pdf document with all the process done.
